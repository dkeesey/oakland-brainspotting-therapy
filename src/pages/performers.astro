				<h2>What is Expansion Brainspotting?</h2>
				<div class="content-flow">
					<p class="lead">
						Expansion Brainspotting is a specialized application of Brainspotting that focuses on performance enhancement, creativity, and accessing resource states—rather than processing trauma or pain.
					</p>

					<h3>Different from Traditional Brainspotting</h3>
					<p>While traditional Brainspotting helps process trauma and pain, Expansion Brainspotting works with your strengths, gifts, and peak experiences. Instead of asking "Where do you feel the problem?", we ask "Where do you feel your creative flow?"</p>

					<h3>Focus on Resource States</h3>
					<p>We identify moments when you felt fully alive, creative, in flow, or performing at your best—and use Brainspotting to expand and strengthen those states. This isn't about fixing what's broken; it's about amplifying what's already working.</p>

					<h3>Performance Enhancement</h3>
					<p>Expansion Brainspotting can help you access flow states more consistently, overcome performance blocks, release creative limitations, and tap into your full creative and performative potential.</p>

					<h3>Creative Flow</h3>
					<p>For artists, writers, musicians, and creatives, Expansion Brainspotting can help you reconnect with your creative source, move through blocks, and find the confidence to share your work with the world.</p>

					<h3>Accessing Peak States</h3>
					<p>Think of a time when you felt completely in your element—performing, creating, or simply being. Expansion Brainspotting helps you neurologically encode that state so you can access it more readily when you need it.</p>

				<h2>Common Challenges Expansion Brainspotting Addresses</h2>
				<div class="content-flow">
					<h3>Performance Anxiety</h3>
					<p>That pit in your stomach before you step on stage, the shaky hands during an audition, the voice in your head saying you're not good enough—performance anxiety can sabotage even the most talented performers. Expansion Brainspotting helps your nervous system learn that performing can be safe, even joyful.</p>

					<h3>Creative Blocks</h3>
					<p>Writer's block, blank canvas paralysis, or feeling creatively dried up. Expansion Brainspotting can help you reconnect with your creative source and rediscover the flow you once had.</p>

					<h3>Imposter Syndrome</h3>
					<p>The persistent feeling that you're not as talented as people think, that you're going to be "found out," or that you don't deserve success. This can keep you from taking creative risks or sharing your gifts fully.</p>

					<h3>Audition Anxiety</h3>
					<p>The high-pressure environment of auditions can trigger intense anxiety that interferes with your ability to show your talent. Expansion Brainspotting helps you access your best self under pressure.</p>

					<h3>Fear of Visibility</h3>
					<p>Many creative people struggle with being seen—whether it's posting your work online, performing publicly, or stepping into leadership. This fear often has roots in past experiences of criticism or rejection.</p>

					<h3>Perfectionism</h3>
					<p>The relentless drive for perfection can paralyze creativity and make performing feel like constant pressure rather than joy. Expansion Brainspotting helps you reconnect with the pleasure and play in your creative work.</p>

				<h2>Oakland's Vibrant Arts Community</h2>
				<div class="content-flow">
					<p>Oakland has one of the most dynamic, diverse arts scenes in the country. From the Fox Theater to street murals, from underground music venues to galleries, Oakland celebrates and nurtures creative expression.</p>

					<p>Yet many Oakland artists struggle with the same challenges creatives face everywhere—balancing artistic vision with financial reality, overcoming self-doubt, and finding the courage to share their work.</p>

					<h3>Why Expansion Brainspotting Fits Oakland</h3>
					<p>Oakland's creative community values authenticity, innovation, and pushing boundaries. Expansion Brainspotting aligns with these values—it's not about conforming to someone else's idea of success, but about accessing your most authentic creative self.</p>

					<p>As a therapist with an MFA in Theatre and extensive training in drama therapy, I understand the creative process from the inside. I've performed, created, and faced the same blocks and fears many artists experience.</p>

				<h2>How Expansion Brainspotting Works</h2>
				<div class="content-flow">
					<h3>Session Structure</h3>
					<p>We start by identifying a peak state—a time when you felt fully in your creative or performance flow. We explore the physical sensations, emotions, and qualities of that state.</p>

					<h3>Identifying Resource States</h3>
					<p>Using your field of vision, we find the eye position that activates and strengthens this resource state. As you hold your gaze there, your brain amplifies and encodes this state neurologically.</p>

					<h3>Building on Strengths</h3>
					<p>Rather than focusing on what's wrong, we focus on what's right—your gifts, your flow, your creativity. We're building neurological pathways that make it easier to access these states when you need them.</p>

					<h3>Timeline</h3>
					<p>Many performers and artists notice shifts within 3-5 sessions—greater confidence, easier access to flow, less performance anxiety. Ongoing sessions can continue to deepen and expand your creative and performative capacities.</p>

					<p>The goal isn't to eliminate all nervousness (some activation can actually enhance performance) but to help you channel that energy into powerful, authentic expression rather than letting it block you.</p>
