					<h2>About Megan</h2>

					<div class="content-flow">
						<p class="lead">
							I became a therapist because I believe deeply in the human capacity for healing and transformation—even when we've experienced profound trauma, loss, or pain.
						</p>

						<p>
							For over 9 years, I've been supporting individuals and couples in the Oakland and Bay Area communities through some of life's most challenging experiences: trauma recovery, grief and loss, anxiety and depression, infertility and pregnancy loss, and creative blocks.
						</p>

						<p>
							What draws me to Brainspotting is its recognition that healing happens not just through talking and understanding, but through working directly with the nervous system and body. Our experiences—both painful and positive—are stored in our brains and bodies in ways that words alone can't always reach. Brainspotting provides a pathway to access and process these deeper layers.
						</p>

						<h3>Why Brainspotting?</h3>

						<p>
							I discovered Brainspotting while searching for more effective ways to help clients who were stuck despite months or years of traditional talk therapy. I saw how quickly and profoundly clients could shift when we worked directly with their nervous systems rather than just their thoughts.
						</p>

						<p>
							What I love about Brainspotting is that it honors each person's unique healing process. You don't have to relive traumatic events in detail. You don't have to have the "right" words. Your brain and body already know how to heal—Brainspotting simply provides the conditions for that healing to unfold.
						</p>

						<h3>Training & Background</h3>

						<p>
							My path to becoming a therapist was unconventional. I hold an MFA in Theatre and completed graduate training in Drama Therapy at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS). This background gives me a unique perspective on creativity, performance, and the body's role in emotional expression.
						</p>

						<p>
							I've pursued specialized training in:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Brainspotting</strong> (Phases 1 & 2, advanced trainings)</li>
							<li><strong>Expansion Brainspotting</strong> for performance and creativity</li>
							<li><strong>Grief Recovery Method</strong></li>
							<li><strong>Play Therapy</strong></li>
							<li><strong>Infertility and reproductive mental health</strong></li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							I provide psychological evaluations for California fertility clinics, supporting intended parents, egg donors, and gestational carriers through the assisted reproduction process.
						</p>

						<h3>Specializations</h3>

						<p>
							While I work with a range of concerns, I have particular expertise in:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Trauma and PTSD (including complex trauma)</li>
							<li>Grief and loss (death, miscarriage, life transitions)</li>
							<li>Anxiety and panic</li>
							<li>Infertility and pregnancy loss</li>
							<li>Performance anxiety and creative blocks</li>
							<li>Work with highly sensitive people (HSPs) and empaths</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Oakland Connection</h3>

						<p>
							I'm honored to serve the Oakland community and the broader Bay Area. Oakland's diversity, resilience, creativity, and strong sense of community deeply resonate with my values as a therapist.
						</p>

						<p>
							I recognize that Oakland residents carry unique experiences—from the ongoing impacts of gentrification and displacement to collective trauma from violence and systemic oppression. I approach therapy with cultural humility and a commitment to creating a space where all aspects of your identity and experience are welcomed.
						</p>

						<h3>My Approach</h3>

						<p>
							I believe therapy should be a collaborative relationship where you feel truly seen, heard, and understood. My approach is warm, direct, and grounded in respect for your autonomy and wisdom.
						</p>

						<p>
							I work especially well with:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Highly sensitive people who feel deeply and need a therapist who gets it</li>
							<li>Empaths who absorb others' emotions and need help setting boundaries</li>
							<li>Creatives and performers seeking to overcome blocks and access flow</li>
							<li>People dealing with complex grief or trauma who need more than traditional talk therapy</li>
							<li>Anyone who feels stuck despite trying other approaches to healing</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							If you're looking for a therapist who combines evidence-based techniques with genuine care, who understands both the science of the nervous system and the art of being human, I'd be honored to work with you.
