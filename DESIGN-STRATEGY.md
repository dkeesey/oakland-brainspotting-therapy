# Oakland Brainspotting Therapy - Design Strategy

## Core Principle: Look Like a Separate Practice

**Goal:** OaklandBrainspottingTherapy.com should appear as an *established Oakland-based Brainspotting practice*, not just another page on Megan's personal site.

**Why This Matters:**
- Google trusts sites that look authoritative and established
- Visitors perceive it as a specialty practice (higher credibility)
- Different design = different brand = separate entity in Google's eyes
- Strengthens local SEO signals

---

## Design Differentiation from MeganGredesky.com

### MeganGredesky.com Current Design:
- Lavender/purple color scheme
- Personal, warm, therapist-focused
- Multiple services highlighted
- Megan's photo prominent

### OaklandBrainspottingTherapy.com NEW Design:
- **Different color palette** (Oakland-inspired)
- **Professional, clinical feel** (less personal, more institutional)
- **Brainspotting-focused** (single specialty)
- **Oakland landmarks** featured
- **Logo/branding** unique to this practice

---

## Brand Identity: Oakland Brainspotting Therapy

### Visual Identity

**Logo Concept:**
- Text: "Oakland Brainspotting Therapy"
- Tagline: "Brain-Based Healing in the Heart of Oakland"
- Icon: Stylized brain + Oakland oak tree leaf
- Colors: Deep blue + forest green

**Color Palette:**

```css
/* Primary Colors (Oakland-inspired) */
--color-oakland-blue: #1B4965;      /* Lake Merritt deep water */
--color-oakland-green: #2D6A4F;     /* Oakland hills forest */
--color-oakland-gold: #CA6F48;      /* East Bay sunset */
--color-oakland-cream: #F5F1E8;     /* Neutral warm */
--color-oakland-steel: #5C6B73;     /* Professional gray */

/* Accent Colors */
--color-brain: #4A90A4;             /* Neural/cognitive blue */
--color-healing: #7FB069;           /* Growth/healing green */
```

**Typography:**
- Headings: **Inter** (modern, professional, Oakland tech vibe)

## Design Elements to Differentiate

### 1. Header/Navigation

**OaklandBrainspottingTherapy.com:**
```
[Logo] Oakland Brainspotting Therapy
       Brain-Based Healing in Oakland

Navigation:
- Home
- About Brainspotting
- Meet Megan
- Contact
- FAQ
```

**Different from MeganGredesky.com:**
- Practice name as brand (not personal name)
- Tagline emphasizes location + modality
- Simpler navigation (single focus)

### 2. Hero Section

**Layout:**
```
[Full-width background: Lake Merritt at golden hour]

H1: "Oakland Brainspotting Therapy"
Subhead: "Healing trauma, anxiety, and grief through
          brain-based therapy in Oakland, CA"

[Large CTA Button]: "Schedule Free Consultation"
[Secondary CTA]: "Learn About Brainspotting"

[Trust Badges Below]:
☑ Licensed LMFT    ☑ Certified Brainspotting Therapist    ☑ 9+ Years Experience
```

**Oakland Elements:**
- Lake Merritt backdrop (iconic Oakland landmark)
- "Oakland, CA" prominent in hero
- Different imagery from Megan's site

### 3. About Section - Practice vs. Person

**Oakland Brainspotting Therapy (Institutional):**
```

through evidence-based, brain-body therapy. Located in the heart
of Oakland, our practice serves clients throughout the Bay Area
seeking compassionate, effective treatment for trauma, anxiety,
grief, and PTSD."
```

**vs. Megan's Site (Personal):**
```
"Hi, I'm Megan Gredesky. I'm passionate about helping empaths
and highly sensitive people find healing..."
```

**Key Difference:** Third-person, practice-focused vs. first-person, personal

### 4. Imagery Strategy

**Oakland Brainspotting:**
- Lake Merritt
- Oakland hills/redwoods
- Grand Lake Theatre (landmark)
- Telegraph Avenue
- Abstract brain/neural imagery
- Professional therapy setting (NOT Megan's specific office photos)

**vs. Megan's Site:**
- Megan's headshot prominent
- Her actual office photos
- Personal, warm imagery
