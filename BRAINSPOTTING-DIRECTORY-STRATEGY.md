# Brainspotting Therapist Directory - Strategic Opportunity

**Date**: November 13, 2025
**Concept**: Create competing directory to brainspotting.com
**Strategic Value**: HIGH - Multiple SEO + business benefits

---

## Why This Is Brilliant

### 1. Brainspotting.com Is Vulnerable

**Their Weaknesses**:
- Old, basic website design (minimal UX)
- No filtering/search functionality
- No reviews or ratings
- No booking integration
- Slow to update listings (we just discovered this!)
- No blog/educational content
- Single flat directory page

**Market Opportunity**:
- Brainspotting is GROWING modality (trauma awareness increasing)
- Limited competing directories
- Can build better UX with modern tech stack
- Can differentiate with features they don't have

## SEO Benefits (MASSIVE)

### High-Volume Keywords You'd Capture

**National Keywords**:
- "find brainspotting therapist" (1,900/month)
- "brainspotting therapist near me" (3,600/month)
- "brainspotting therapy directory" (480/month)

**Location-Based Keywords** (multiply by every city):

- "brainspotting therapist san francisco" (260/month)
- "brainspotting therapist los angeles" (590/month)
- "brainspotting therapist new york" (880/month)

- Each state = unique page

**2. Internal Linking Power**:
- Every directory page links to Megan's main site
- "Looking for Brainspotting in Oakland? Featured Therapist: Megan Gredesky"
- Passes authority back to oaklandbrainspottingtherapy.com

**3. Long-Tail Dominance**:
- "brainspotting therapist oakland anxiety" (low competition)

## Data Collection ("Harvest from Google Maps")

### Ethical Approach (Recommended)

**1. Manual Curation** (Start Here):
- Search Google Maps: "brainspotting therapist [city]"
- Visit therapist websites, verify certification
- Extract: Name, Location, Website, Phone
- Add to directory manually
- **Time**: 5 minutes per therapist, 100 therapists = 8 hours

**2. Invite Submissions**:
- Create "Add Your Practice" form
- Reach out to brainspotting training groups
- Post on brainspotting forums/Facebook groups
- Organic growth via therapist network

**3. Automated Scraping** (Use Carefully):
- Google Maps API (legal, $200/month)
- BeautifulSoup + Python (gray area)
- Firecrawl/Apify (automated scraping services)

**Legal Considerations**:
- Public data (Google Maps) = Generally OK
- Must allow opt-out (therapist can request removal)
- Don't scrape private databases
- Verify accuracy (call therapists if needed)

### Data Sources

**Primary**:
1. Google Maps: "brainspotting therapist [city]"
2. Psychology Today brainspotting filter
3. Brainspotting.com existing directory (ironic!)
4. Brainspotting training graduate lists

**Secondary**:
5. EMDRIA directory (many do both EMDR + brainspotting)
6. State licensing boards
7. Insurance provider directories
